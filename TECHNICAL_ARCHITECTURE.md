# LEAD GENERATION PIPELINE - TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
## System Design & Implementation Documentation

---

## OVERVIEW

This document outlines the technical architecture used to build a B2B lead generation pipeline. The system utilized a distributed, file-based coordination model with multiple AI agents working in parallel across different market verticals.

---

## ARCHITECTURE COMPONENTS

### Core MCP (Model Context Protocol) Tools Used

#### 1. **Firecrawl MCP (`mcp__firecrawl__*`)**
- **Purpose**: Primary web scraping and content extraction
- **Tools Utilized**:
  - `firecrawl_scrape`: Single URL content extraction
  - `firecrawl_search`: Web search with content extraction
  - `firecrawl_map`: Website URL discovery
- **Implementation**: Initially chosen for comprehensive scraping but replaced due to performance/blocking issues

#### 2. **Sequential Thinking MCP (`mcp__sequential-thinking__*`)**
- **Purpose**: Complex problem-solving and analytical reasoning
- **Usage**: PM decision-making, error analysis, quality auditing
- **Implementation**: Step-by-step logical reasoning for complex decisions

#### 3. **Memory Graph MCP (`mcp__memory__*`)**
- **Purpose**: Knowledge graph for entity relationships
- **Tools**: `create_entities`, `search_nodes`, `add_observations`
- **Usage**: Track companies, relationships, and market intelligence

#### 4. **Puppeteer MCP (`mcp__puppeteer__*`)**
- **Purpose**: Browser automation for complex sites
- **Tools**: `navigate`, `screenshot`, `click`, `fill`
- **Implementation**: Backup scraping method for JavaScript-heavy sites

### Custom Infrastructure

#### 1. **Crawl4AI Integration**
```python
# /shared/c4a_fetch.py - Custom async web crawler
async def fetch(urls, outdir):
    async with AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_cfg) as crawler:
        r = await crawler.arun(url=url, config=run_cfg)
        with open(md_path, "w") as f:
            f.write(r.markdown.fit_markdown)
```
- **Purpose**: Replace Firecrawl for better reliability
- **Features**: Async processing, markdown extraction, metadata capture
- **Benefits**: Better handling of blocked sites, faster processing

#### 2. **File-Based Coordination System**
```bash
# /shared/ops.sh - Coordination helpers
status_set() { echo "$(stamp) $2" > "$SHARED/status/$1.status" }
wait_approval() { until grep -q "$2" "$f"; do sleep 2; done }
reserve_slot() { mkdir "$SHARED/locks/$TOKEN" }
```

## DATA ARCHITECTURE

### Schema-Driven Development

#### Lead Schema (`common/schemas/lead_schema.json`)
```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["company","vertical","city","state","source_urls","confidence"],
  "properties": {
    "company": {"type":"string"},
    "facility_name": {"type":"string"},
    "vertical": {"type":"string"},
    "floor_type_signals": {"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},
    "compliance_drivers": {"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},
    "confidence": {"type":"number"}
  }
}
```

#### Scoring Rules (`common/rules/score.yaml`)
```yaml
weights:
  base_confidence: 0.2
  active_procurement: 0.15
  
flooring_signals:
  epoxy|resinous|polyaspartic: 30
  cleanroom|gmp|antimicrobial: 20
  
facility_modifiers:
  manufacturing|pharma|lab: 25
  runway|parking_lot: -25
  
priority:
  A: 80
  B: 60
  C: 0
```

### Data Flow Pipeline

```
RAW DATA → VALIDATION → SCORING → PRIORITIZATION → EXPORT
    ↓           ↓          ↓           ↓            ↓
  .md/.json   JSONL    scored.csv  priority.csv  CRM.csv
```

## TEAM COORDINATION MODEL

### File-Based Communication System

#### 1. **Task Assignment**
```bash
# Tasks written to /shared/tasks/{vertical}.task
cat > "$SHARED/tasks/healthcare.task" <<'EOF'
STEP2 - Compile & Validate
Take all *.json extracts from verticals/healthcare/raw/
Validate against schema at common/schemas/lead_schema.json
STOP after writing report. Announce "STEP2 done".
EOF
```

#### 2. **Status Tracking**
```bash
# Status files in /shared/status/
echo "STEP1B_OK" > "$SHARED/status/healthcare.status"
echo "STEP2_DONE" > "$SHARED/status/pharma.status"
```

#### 3. **Approval Gates**
```bash
# Approval tokens in /shared/approvals/
touch "$SHARED/approvals/PHARMA_STEP3_OK"
```

#### 4. **Message Queues**
- **Outbound**: `/shared/messages/{vertical}.md` (PM → Worker)
- **Inbound**: `/shared/replies/{vertical}_reply.md` (Worker → PM)
- **Logging**: `/shared/inbox_pm.md` (audit trail)

### Worker Specialization

#### PM (Project Manager) Agent
- **Role**: Orchestration, quality control, task assignment
- **Tools**: All MCP tools, file coordination, audit functions
- **Responsibilities**: Gate approvals, error detection, final packaging

#### Healthcare Worker Agent
- **Role**: Healthcare vertical lead generation
- **Scope**: Hospitals, clinics, healthcare facilities in CT/NY
- **Tools**: Firecrawl MCP, schema validation
- **Output**: Healthcare-specific leads with medical compliance focus

#### Pharma Worker Agent
- **Role**: Pharmaceutical vertical lead generation  
- **Scope**: Pharma companies, labs, cleanroom facilities
- **Tools**: Firecrawl MCP, specialized pharma research
- **Output**: High-value pharma leads with GMP/cleanroom requirements

#### Culinary Worker Agent
- **Role**: Food service vertical lead generation
- **Scope**: Restaurants, breweries, food processing, schools
- **Tools**: Firecrawl MCP, alternative source discovery
- **Output**: Food-safe flooring opportunities

## TECHNOLOGY STACK

### Programming Languages & Frameworks
- **Python**: Crawl4AI implementation, async processing
- **Bash**: Coordination scripts, environment management
- **YAML**: Configuration files, scoring rules
- **JSON**: Data schemas, structured output
- **Markdown**: Documentation, reports, communications

### External APIs & Services
- **Firecrawl API**: Web scraping (primary, then replaced)
- **Crawl4AI**: Custom web crawling (replacement)
- **MCP Protocol**: Tool orchestration and AI agent communication

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Extraction**: URLs → Raw content (.md/.json)
2. **Validation**: Raw → Schema-compliant JSONL
3. **Scoring**: JSONL → Scored CSV with priorities
4. **Export**: Scored → CRM-ready formats

---

## SCALING & CONCURRENCY

### Slot-Based Throttling
```python
# Crawling with slot management
MAX_SLOTS = 3
current_slots = len(os.listdir("$SHARED/locks/"))
if current_slots < MAX_SLOTS:
    reserve_slot(worker_token)
    execute_crawl()
    release_slot(worker_token)
```

### Parallel Processing
- **Vertical Isolation**: Each worker operates on separate vertical
- **File Locking**: Prevents resource conflicts
- **Asynchronous Tasks**: Non-blocking operations where possible

### Git Worktree Strategy
```bash
# Separate branches for each vertical
git worktree add verticals/healthcare healthcare-branch
git worktree add verticals/pharma pharma-branch
git worktree add verticals/culinary culinary-branch
```

---

## ERROR HANDLING & QUALITY CONTROL

### Multi-Level Validation
1. **Schema Validation**: JSON schema compliance
2. **Business Rules**: Scoring formula application
3. **Geographic Validation**: Location filtering
4. **Quality Gates**: PM approval checkpoints

### Error Recovery
- **Retry Logic**: Failed extractions automatically retry
- **Fallback Methods**: Crawl4AI replaces Firecrawl on failure
- **Manual Override**: PM can correct worker errors

### Monitoring & Logging
```bash
# Comprehensive logging system
echo "[PM] $(date +%H:%M) STEP2 tasks issued" >> "$SHARED/inbox_pm.md"
echo "$(stamp) STEP1B_DONE" > "$SHARED/status/healthcare.status"
```

---

## PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS

### Throughput
- **Lead Processing**: ~12 leads per hour (with validation)
- **URL Extraction**: ~50 URLs per hour
- **Concurrent Workers**: 3 verticals simultaneously

### Resource Usage
- **Storage**: ~500MB for complete pipeline
- **Memory**: Minimal (file-based coordination)
- **Network**: Throttled to respect site limits

---

## SECURITY & COMPLIANCE

### Data Protection
- **No Credentials Stored**: All scraping uses public sources
- **GDPR Compliance**: Only public business information
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects robots.txt and site policies

### Access Control
- **File Permissions**: Restricted worker access to assigned directories
- **Audit Trail**: Complete operation logging
- **Data Retention**: Configurable cleanup policies

---

## LESSONS LEARNED & IMPROVEMENTS

### What Worked
1. **File-based coordination** - Simple, reliable, debuggable

4. **Evidence collection** - URLs provided instead of actual files

### Recommended Improvements
1. **Automated geographic filtering**
2. **Direct contact discovery APIs**
3. **Evidence file requirements**
4. **Scoring algorithm transparency**
5. **Competitive intelligence integration**

## CONCLUSION

This architecture demonstrates a successful implementation of distributed AI agent coordination for lead generation. The file-based communication model, while simple, proved effective for coordinating multiple specialized workers while maintaining audit trails and quality control.

The key innovation was using MCP tools to provide AI agents with real-world capabilities (web scraping, data processing, file manipulation) while maintaining structure through schemas and coordination protocols.

Despite execution issues (geographic misses, contact quality), the technical architecture successfully scaled to process multiple verticals simultaneously and delivered structured, usable output for the client.
