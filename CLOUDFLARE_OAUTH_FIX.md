# üîß Fix Google Sheets OAuth on Cloudflare Pages

The Google OAuth integration isn't working because the redirect URI is configured for Railway, but you're now using Cloudflare Pages for the frontend.

## üéØ Quick Fix

You need to update **ONE environment variable** in both Railway AND Cloudflare:

### Step 1: Get Your Cloudflare Pages URL

Your Cloudflare Pages URL is probably something like:
```
https://ai-lead-scrape.pages.dev
```

Or if it's a custom deployment:
```
https://ai-lead-scrape-xxx.pages.dev
```

### Step 2: Update Google Cloud Console

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID (the one you're using)
3. Click "Edit"
4. Under **"Authorized redirect URIs"**, ADD these URLs:

```
https://ai-lead-scrape-production.up.railway.app/auth/google/callback
https://your-cloudflare-url.pages.dev/api/auth/google/callback
```

**Important:** Add BOTH URLs so it works from both Railway and Cloudflare!

### Step 3: Update Cloudflare Environment Variables

In your Cloudflare Pages dashboard:

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment variables**
2. Find `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`
3. Change it to:
```
https://ai-lead-scrape-production.up.railway.app/auth/google/callback
```

**Note:** Keep it pointing to Railway because that's where your backend API is running!

### Step 4: Redeploy

1. In Cloudflare, click **"Retry deployment"** or **"Create deployment"**
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Test the Google Sheets integration again

## üîç Why This Happens

- **Frontend**: Running on Cloudflare Pages (`https://ai-lead-scrape.pages.dev`)
- **Backend**: Running on Railway (`https://ai-lead-scrape-production.up.railway.app`)
- **API Proxy**: Cloudflare Functions proxy `/api/*` requests to Railway
- **OAuth Flow**: Google redirects back to the backend callback URL

---

## ‚úÖ Complete Fix (Alternative)

If the above doesn't work, you can also update the frontend to use the Railway API directly:

### Option 1: Set VITE_API_URL in Cloudflare

Add this environment variable in Cloudflare Pages:

```
VITE_API_URL=https://ai-lead-scrape-production.up.railway.app
```

Then redeploy. This makes the frontend directly call Railway instead of using the proxy.

### Option 2: Update _redirects File

The `_redirects` file should proxy OAuth requests. Make sure it includes:

```
/api/auth/google/*  https://ai-lead-scrape-production.up.railway.app/auth/google/:splat  200
```

## üß™ Test the Fix

After making changes:

1. Go to your Cloudflare Pages URL
2. Click "Connect Google Sheets"
3. You should see Google's OAuth consent screen
4. After authorizing, you should be redirected back to your app

## üìù Current Configuration

Your environment variables should look like this:

**In Cloudflare Pages:**
```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyDjnfAynqW9F-nn8EiYYA2-QZtTP-p-UTK
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=404c0e062056459a
CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=932138610546-t5k6tcbv5jc23q8l0n445t90admctboky.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=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
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=https://ai-lead-scrape-production.up.railway.app/auth/google/callback
BACKEND_URL=https://ai-lead-scrape-production.up.railway.app
ENVIRONMENT=production
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

---

## üÜò Still Not Working?

Check these:

1. **Browser Console**: Look for CORS errors or failed API calls
2. **Railway Logs**: Check if OAuth requests are reaching the backend
3. **Google Console**: Verify the redirect URI is whitelisted
4. **Cloudflare Functions**: Check if the proxy is working (`/api` requests)
