# Current Status - AI Lead Generation Platform

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-17 (after frontend routing fix)

## 🎉 Latest Fix: Frontend Navigation Working!

### Problem Solved
- ✅ **Frontend routing now works correctly**
- ✅ Navigation between pages (`/dashboard`, `/leads`, `/research`) works
- ✅ Browser refresh on any route works
- ✅ Direct URL access to routes works

### What Was Fixed
Added FastAPI catch-all route to handle React Router's client-side navigation. See [FRONTEND_ROUTING_FIX.md](./FRONTEND_ROUTING_FIX.md) for full details.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Railway Public Domain Routing (May Be Resolved)
**Status**: User generated new domain, testing in progress

**Previous Issue**: 
- App started successfully
- Health checks passed (200 OK)
- But public domain showed "Application failed to respond"

**Evidence It's Infrastructure Issue (Not Code)**:
- ✅ App runs perfectly internally
- ✅ Health checks return 200 OK
- ✅ Real research engine loads
- ✅ Google API works
- ❌ Only public routing failed

**Current Action**:
- User generated new Railway domain
- Testing new domain URL
- Railway CLI diagnostic commands available

---

## 🔍 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ **Test new Railway domain** (user-initiated)
2. ✅ **Verify frontend navigation works** (fixed with catch-all route)
3. ⏳ **Confirm full app functionality**

### If Railway Domain Works
1. Test complete lead generation workflow
2. Verify Google Sheets export
3. Test job status updates
4. Monitor logs for any issues

### If Railway Still Has Issues
1. Use Railway CLI for diagnosis
2. Check Railway dashboard settings
3. Consider alternative deployment (Render, Fly.io, Cloud Run)
