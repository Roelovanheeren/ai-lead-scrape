## Critical Discrepancy Analysis

### Worker vs PM Scoring
- **Worker reported:** All Priority A (scores 100)
- **Actual calculation:** All Priority C (scores 52-55)
- **Root cause:** Worker incorrectly inflated scores; actual implementation correctly applied rules

### Scoring Breakdown (Actual)
- Active RFP/bid: +20 points
- Aviation facility match: +15 points  
- Recent (<180 days): +10 points
- Official source: +10 points
- Westchester penalty (bidbanana): -15 points
- **Missing:** Compliance drivers (25 pts), distress signals (6 pts)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Worker scoring logic** - Prevent score inflation
2. **Do not pursue** current aviation leads - Low epoxy potential
3. **Validate** all Priority A claims before delivery

### Next Verticals (Better Fit)
1. **Manufacturing** - Chemical resistance needs
2. **Healthcare** - Sanitary flooring requirements
3. **Food Processing** - USDA compliance
4. **Warehousing** - Heavy traffic durability

### Aviation Adjustments (If Continuing)
- Target: Hangars, terminals, maintenance facilities
- Avoid: Runways, parking lots, airside pavements
- Add search terms: "hangar flooring", "fuel containment"

## Conclusion

Aviation vertical shows limited epoxy flooring opportunities. All leads are legitimate construction projects but lack explicit flooring requirements. Scoring system worked correctly when properly applied. Recommend pivoting to manufacturing or healthcare verticals for better-aligned opportunities.

**Data Quality:** 100% schema compliant, 100% evidence documented  
**Next Step:** Await PM decision on vertical pivot
